# SPCE Manage

**SPCE Manage** is a desktop application developed for SPCE (Service Port and the Coastal Environment), a company based in Toamasina, Madagascar. SPCE is responsible for collecting and managing garbage from commercial ships at the Port of Toamasina, in accordance with **MARPOL Annex V** â€“ Garbage regulations.

This software was specifically designed to streamline and digitalize their ship waste processing workflow. It is not intended for general public use but is open-sourced as part of my professional portfolio to demonstrate my capabilities in desktop software development using **Qt, C++ and QML**.

## Features

### ðŸš¢ Ship Information Management
- **Display Upcoming Ships:** Automatically lists ships scheduled to arrive at the Port of Toamasina.
- **Display Latest Arrivals:** View ships that have recently docked.
- **Search Functionality:** Easily locate ships by name or IMO number.

### ðŸ“„ Document Generation
Generates essential documents required for MARPOL compliance and operational processing:
- **Waste Delivery Certificate**  
  Follows *APPENDIX 3: Standard Format for the Waste Delivery Receipt*.
- **BSD (Bordereau de Suivi des DÃ©chets Portuaires)**  
  A mandatory waste tracking document.
- **Invoice Generation**  
  Auto-generates invoice details per ship operation.
